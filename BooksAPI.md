### Setup

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone [REPO_URL]
cd [REPO_NAME]
```

Replace [REPO_URL] with the link to your GitHub repository and [REPO_NAME] with the repository's name.

#### 2. Install Dependencies

Open a terminal at the root of the repo directory and run the following command to install the dependencies:

```sh
./mvnw clean dependency:resolve
```

If you are on a Windows machine, that will be:
```cmd

```

You should see console output similar to the following:
